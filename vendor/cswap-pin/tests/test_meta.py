    pytest has no default per-test timeout, so one `recv` on a peer that
    accepts and never answers does not fail the case — it stops the run, and
    the job idles to whatever outer cap exists with nothing reported. A peer
    session measured exactly that on its own runner: one job past 43 minutes
    while its siblings finished in 39 seconds, and NO check anywhere said
    "failed".

    A global timeout is the wrong fix and is deliberately not used here: a
    value large enough for a slow machine cannot catch a hang, and one small
    enough to catch it turns a slow machine red. This reads source instead —
    it cannot make a slow runner fail, only an unbounded call.

    WHY A GUARD RATHER THAN CARE. The same peer swept its suite BY HAND three
    times and missed the same shape three times; my own sweep of this suite
    was by hand too. Judgement does not scale to a file that keeps growing.
